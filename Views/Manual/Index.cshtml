This brief guide is used to help the online Nutrition database users on how to use the different parts of the database.
</p>

<h2 id="login">Login</h2>

<h2 id ="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
<p>The dashboard is a visual display of the some selected information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.
</p>

<br>
<h2 id="pivot">Pivot Table</h2>
<p>
    In database and statistics, reports are what you use to <strong> summarize</strong> and <strong> present</strong> data in the tables. A report usually answers a specific question, such as "How many under 5 children cured during this year?" or "Which provinces have the highest death rate?‚Äù. Each report can be formatted to present the information in the most readable way possible.
A report can be run at any time, and will always reflect the current data in the database. </p>
<p>
The nutrition reports are supposed to be viewed using <strong> Excel pivot table</strong> it is because of the flexibility of the program and convenience of users in working with Excel.
</p>
<p>
A pivot table report is an interactive table that quickly combines and compares large amounts of data. You can rotate its rows and columns to see different summaries of the source data, and you can display the details for areas of interest. In order to facilitate customized data analysis, the nutrition database has feature that the pivot table will be created automatically in Excel. This allows looking and examining data closely and doing different analysis from different angles. 
</p>
<p>
The data tabulation, frequency and percentage tables will be prepared automatically using the database in excel pivot table with just a single click. You can have full access to the data where you can simply copy and paste them with a little formatting that may be required. In addition, you can create your own simple and complex charts and graphs by arranging or organizing the data. 
</p>
<h2 id="createpivot">Create Pivot Table</h2>
<p>
The following screen shot is where you can create pivot table. You can create pivot for all <strong>Provinces</strong> and all <strong>Years</strong> for 
a single <strong>Pivot Type</strong> or create pivot table for single <strong>Province</strong> and/or single <strong> Year</strong>.
</p>
<p>
To create a <strong>Pivot Table</strong>, select a <strong>Province</strong> or <strong>All</strong> from the dropdown and then select a <strong>Year</strong> or leave <strong>All</strong> from the <strong>Year</strong> dropdown.
Then select a report from the <strong>Pivot Type</strong> dropdown and then click on the <strong>Generate</strong> button.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Care for Quality of Data</h2>
<p>
    It is important to check the data that is being entered into database is accurate and reliable. Having no data is better than inaccurate data. Erroneous data may lead to wrong decisions. For example, an inaccurate record of patient‚Äôs reaction to penicillin may lead to a doctor to harm the patient while believing that she/he is helping him.
</p>
<p>
    Data accuracy or quality of data is not responsibility of one or two persons. It is everyone‚Äôs job. The typist, tally person, head of the project. But the accuracy of NUTRITION data is mostly dependent of tally person or the base where data is gathered namely the health facility is the base of accurate and inaccurate data. 
</p>
<p>
    The other person who is responsible for data quality is the person who enters data into database. He/she shall not only care about data entry while typing into database but he should make sure the data that enters into database is fine and make correction if there is any problem with the source data in the hard copy or tally. He should also make this ethic for him to double check data after every data entry of a report and regularly check quality of data using pivot table and provide feedback in order to minimize errors or mistakes in the data.
</p>
<p>
    In this paper we focus on the accuracy check of the data entered in the database. Database is not that wise to check if 4 odema for <6 children was recorded as 4 6-24 months. But it will check that duplicate record is not entered, alarm when total number of male and female is not matching with total number of new admission in MAM and do some other validation check.
</p>
<p>
    You may do the following checking and precautions during data entry or after data entry to monitor the quality of data entered into database:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Before you enter data into database, check that the data you have collected is correct and complete</li>
 <li>Try to fill all of the blank fields</li>
 <li>While typing be very careful not to type 222 instead of 2</li>
 <li>Give full attention when typing and make sure you type on the right place and is not entered in the wrong place</li>
 <li>Have glance on data that is very big or seems unusual and correct if any</li>
 <li>Big number of refer in, deaths, defaulters and other requires full attention</li>
 <li>Make sure the total number of exits is not bigger than total admission</li>
 <li>Make sure total at the end is not negative number</li>
 <li>Make full attention to red colors in the data entry screens</li>
 <li>Make sure data is complete</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When analyzing data you may consider the following items:</p>
    <li>Look for large gaps in the data</li>
    <li>Look for unusual month to month variations</li>
    <li>Check for duplication in reporting or repetitive</li>
    <li>Check for inconsistencies ‚Äì unlikely values</li>
    <li>Look for data present where there should not be</li>
    <li>There might be typing errors if there is a very large data</li>
    <li>Check that data is not entered in wrong places</li>
